# Getting Started

## Communication

All primary group communication should be done in this github repository, and on Zoom. That means that if you have a task for the group, create it as an issue on the project board.

If you have something you need to discuss with the group, create it as an issue/task in github, and we can all comment on it and attach relevant files etc.

## Adding Tasks

1. Go to the project board and create a new 'Card' in the 'ToDo' column.
2. Convert the card to an issue by clicking on it's settings and converting it.
3. Add the task to the 'Project Complete' milestone so we can see our overall progress.

By Adding tasks as issues, other members can see your progress, and collaborate/review each others work.

## Submitting Code

This section will cover how to submit code to complete a task/issue or to simply update the repo with new code/progress for the project.

You should create a new branch for every aspect/feature/task of the website. **DO NOT** Commit directly to the main branch. Once the feature is complete, we can simply merge it into the main branch.


Here are the steps when submitting code:

1. Ensure you are on a *different* branch to **main**, then push all commits to that branch.
2. Create a new pull request in github, this can be related to an issue, or just a direct pull request.
3. Once the pull request is created, you can ask for feedback from the group. You won't be able to merge your changes until at least 1 other member has approved them. (We can change this later if it becomes an issue, however this is to ensure a certain 'quality' control, and to facilitate good communication/transparency in the team).
4. Once approved, you can merge your changes into the main branch.
